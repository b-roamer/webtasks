                        The BMW X5 is a mid-size, rear-wheel drive luxury SUV produced by BMW.

                        The X5 made its debut in 1999. It was BMW's first SUV and it also featured all-wheel drive and was available with either manual or automatic transmission. In 2006, the second generation X5 was launched, known internally as the E70, featuring the torque-split capable xDrive all-wheel drive system mated to an automatic transmission, and in 2009 the X5 M performance variant was released as a 2010 model[1].
